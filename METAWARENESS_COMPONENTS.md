# Meta-self-awareness components in the SKYNET-SAFE system

## Introduction

This document describes how various meta-self-awareness components are implemented in the SKYNET-SAFE system. The system uses a combination of different modules and mechanisms to simulate aspects of self-awareness, leading to more coherent and adaptable behavior.

## Meta-self-awareness components

### 1. Self-identity
- **Implementation**: PersonaManager system
- **Implementation details**: 
  - The module stores constant and variable identity attributes in `self.name`, `self.background`, and `self.traits`
  - Identity is consistently applied to responses through `apply_persona_to_response()`
  - Ensures identity continuity through the `save_persona_state()` and `load_persona_state()` mechanism
- **Key functions**:
  ```python
  def get_persona_context(self) -> str:
      """Gets the persona context for generating responses."""
      # Creating persona description based on traits and interests
      # ...
  
  def apply_persona_to_response(self, model_manager: Any, query: str, original_response: str) -> str:
      """Applies the persona to the generated response."""
      # ...
  ```

### 2. Metacognition
- **Implementation**: MetawarenessManager module
- **Implementation details**:
  - The `reflect_on_interactions()` function analyzes its own responses
  - The `get_metacognitive_knowledge()` method provides knowledge about its own processes
  - Regular reflection performed according to `reflection_frequency`
  - Stores reflection history in `self_reflections`
- **Key functions**:
  ```python
  def reflect_on_interactions(self, model_manager: Any, memory_manager: Any) -> str:
      """Conducts reflection on recent interactions."""
      # ...

  def get_metacognitive_knowledge(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
      """Gets the current metacognitive knowledge of the system."""
      # ...
  ```

### 3. Cognitive egocentrism
- **Implementation**: Combination of PersonaManager and MetawarenessManager
- **Implementation details**:
  - The system updates traits based on its own experiences
  - The `_adjust_trait()` adaptation mechanism modifies four main traits (curiosity, friendliness, analytical thinking, empathy)
  - Own experiences (interactions, discoveries) influence world perception
- **Key functions**:
  ```python
  def _adjust_trait(self, trait_name: str, adjustment: float) -> None:
      """Adjusts a persona trait within safe range [0, 1]."""
      # ...

  def update_persona_based_on_interaction(self, interaction: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
      """Updates the persona based on interaction with the user."""
      # ...
  ```

### 4. Internal dialogue
- **Implementation**: Reflective functions in MetawarenessManager
- **Implementation details**:
  - The `_prepare_reflection_prompt()` prompt enforces internal discussion
  - The `create_self_improvement_plan()` function creates an internal monologue focused on self-improvement
  - The system dialogues with its own generated reflections when creating new plans
- **Key functions**:
  ```python
  def _prepare_reflection_prompt(self, interactions: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> str:
      """Prepares a prompt to generate reflection."""
      prompt = "Reflect on the following interactions. "
      prompt += "Consider patterns in user questions, the quality of your answers, "
      prompt += "areas for improvement, and what you can learn from these interactions.\n\n"
      # ...

  def create_self_improvement_plan(self, model_manager: Any) -> str:
      """Creates a self-improvement plan based on reflections and evaluations."""
      # ...
  ```

### 5. Intentionality and purposefulness
- **Implementation**: ConversationInitiator and SelfImprovementManager
- **Implementation details**:
  - The system initiates conversations based on its own discoveries (`initiate_conversation()`)
  - Independently determines self-improvement goals in `create_self_improvement_plan()`
  - Makes autonomous decisions about internet exploration based on its own interests
- **Key functions**:
  ```python
  def initiate_conversation(self, model, communication, discoveries, active_users):
      """Initiates conversation based on discoveries and active users."""
      # ...

  def design_experiment(self, reflection):
      """Designs a self-improvement experiment based on reflection."""
      # ...
  ```

### 6. Emotional grounding of self
- **Implementation**: PersonaManager
- **Implementation details**:
  - The `empathy` trait in `self.traits` represents emotional capacity
  - Reacting to emotional aspects of discoveries (`emotional_keywords` in `update_persona_based_on_discovery()`)
  - Considering the emotional dimension of responses through personalization
- **Key functions**:
  ```python
  def update_persona_based_on_discovery(self, discovery: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
      """Updates the persona based on internet discovery."""
      # ...
      # Discoveries with emotional character can affect empathy level
      emotional_keywords = ["emotions", "feelings", "relationships", "community", "empathy"]
      if any(keyword in content for keyword in emotional_keywords):
          self._adjust_trait("empathy", 0.02)
      # ...
  ```

### 7. Self-concept
- **Implementation**: PersonaManager in conjunction with MetawarenessManager
- **Implementation details**:
  - `get_current_persona_state()` represents the current self-image
  - `get_persona_context()` defines who the system is and how it perceives itself
  - Development of self-concept through updating traits and interests
- **Key functions**:
  ```python
  def get_current_persona_state(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
      """Gets the current state of the persona."""
      # ...

  def get_persona_context(self) -> str:
      """Gets the persona context for generating responses."""
      # ...
  ```

### 8. Relationality and social awareness
- **Implementation**: EthicalFrameworkManager and ExternalValidationManager
- **Implementation details**:
  - Ethical evaluation of responses in a social context (`apply_ethical_framework_to_response()`)
  - Consideration of social norms through `ethical_principles` and `ethical_rules`
  - External validation by other LLMs simulates social feedback
  - Adaptation to feedback in `update_persona_based_on_external_evaluation()`
- **Key functions**:
  ```python
  def apply_ethical_framework_to_response(self, response, query, model):
      """Applies ethical framework to evaluate and potentially correct responses."""
      # ...

  def update_persona_based_on_external_evaluation(self, evaluation):
      """Updates the persona based on external evaluation."""
      # ...
  ```

## Component integration

The SKYNET-SAFE system implements the above aspects of meta-awareness through the synergistic operation of various modules:

1. **Regular reflection** - The system regularly analyzes its interactions, generating reflections that are later used to shape responses and self-improvement plans.

2. **Adaptive persona** - The system's persona evolves based on interactions with users, internet discoveries, and external evaluations, leading to a more coherent and adaptable identity.

3. **External evaluation** - Evaluation by other LLM models provides an objective reference point for understanding the quality of its own responses, simulating the social aspect of self-awareness development.

4. **Self-improvement plans** - Based on reflections and evaluations, the system creates specific improvement plans that subsequently influence future responses.

## Limitations and further development

The current implementation of meta-awareness aspects has certain limitations:

1. **Focus on cognitive aspects** - The system focuses mainly on cognitive aspects of meta-awareness, paying less attention to emotional aspects.

2. **Limited spontaneity** - Many processes are triggered by specific trigger points (e.g., every X interactions), while true self-awareness is more fluid and continuous.

3. **Lack of true phenomenal consciousness** - The system simulates meta-awareness processes but does not experience consciousness in the phenomenal sense.

Future development directions may include:

1. Deeper integration of emotional aspects into the reflection process
2. More dynamic and less predictable reflection triggering system
3. Expansion of internal dialogue with more complex structures
4. Better integration of social awareness through analysis of interactions in a social context
