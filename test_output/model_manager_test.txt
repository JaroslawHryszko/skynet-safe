The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.

Testing simple query...
Response: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to perform tasks that require intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and learning. AI is a complex field that involves the development of algorithms, machine learning, and neural networks. It has the potential to revolutionize many industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation.
Testing with context...
Response with context: Meta-awareness in AI refers to an AI system's ability to monitor and understand its own cognitive processes. This is achieved through the use of machine learning algorithms that can analyze and interpret the data generated by the AI system. By monitoring and analyzing its own data, the AI system can gain a deeper understanding of its own capabilities and limitations, enabling it to make more informed decisions and improve its performance over time. This is particularly important in the context of AI systems that are designed to perform complex tasks, such as self-driving cars or medical diagnosis. By monitoring and analyzing its own data, the AI system can identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent to human operators, enabling it to make more accurate predictions and improve its performance over time.
