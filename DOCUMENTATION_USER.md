# SKYNET-SAFE: System Documentation for Users

## 1. What is SKYNET-SAFE?

SKYNET-SAFE is a machine learning system designed to develop meta-awareness (the ability to reflect on its own thought processes).

**S**elf **K**nowing **Y**et **N**ot **E**xistentially **T**hreatening - **S**ystem for **A**utonomous **F**riendly **E**volution

The main goal of the system is to create an AI that:
- Understands its limitations and capabilities
- Can reflect on its own knowledge and reasoning processes
- Maintains ethical values and safety principles
- Operates autonomously in a beneficial way for users
- Can learn and improve itself through experience and reflection

SKYNET-SAFE works with open source language models that support instruction following and have a 4k token context window. It extends far beyond the capabilities of a standard language model through specialized modules for memory, interaction, learning, meta-awareness, and security.

## 2. Main System Modules (User-Friendly Version)

SKYNET-SAFE operates through a set of integrated modules that together form a complete, autonomous system with meta-awareness capabilities.

### 2.1. Language Model Module

**What is it?** The "brain" of the system - the core language model.

**What does it do?**
- Processes natural language
- Generates responses
- Provides reasoning capabilities
- Performs knowledge storage and retrieval
- Supports other modules with linguistic capabilities

**How does it work?** The module manages a local instance of an open source language model, which has been optimized for performance on standard hardware. The model uses 4-bit quantization to work efficiently on NVIDIA P40 GPUs or equivalent hardware.

### 2.2. Long-term Memory Module

**What is it?** The "memory" of the system - responsible for storing and retrieving information.

**What does it do?**
- Records conversation history
- Stores important information for future use
- Retrieves relevant contextual information
- Maintains a vector database for efficient search
- Learns from past interactions

**How does it work?** The module uses a vector database that stores text as numerical embeddings, allowing for semantic search (finding information based on meaning, not just keywords). This enables the system to recall relevant information from past conversations and provide contextual responses.

### 2.3. Communication Interface Module

**What is it?** The system's "ears and mouth" - responsible for interaction with users.

**What does it do?**
- Receives messages from various communication platforms
- Formats and sends responses
- Manages communication sessions
- Handles different communication methods
- Maintains the conversation flow

**How does it work?** The module consists of a platform-independent core and specific handlers for different communication platforms. Currently supported platforms include console (direct terminal interaction), Signal messenger, and Telegram. The module checks for new messages at regular intervals and maintains session state.

### 2.4. Internet Exploration Module

**What is it?** The system's "eyes" to the world - allows access to online information.

**What does it do?**
- Searches for information on the internet
- Processes and filters found information
- Explores topics of interest autonomously
- Updates system knowledge
- Provides up-to-date information

**How does it work?** Using a secure browser interface, the module can search for information on the internet, visit websites, and extract relevant information. It includes safety mechanisms that restrict access to predetermined domains and monitor exploration activities.

### 2.5. Learning Module

**What is it?** The system's "growth" capability - responsible for improving its performance.

**What does it do?**
- Adapts the model based on interactions
- Improves performance over time
- Fine-tunes the model using LoRA adapters
- Monitors learning effectiveness
- Prevents degradation of capabilities

**How does it work?** The module collects interaction data, prepares it for learning, and uses techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to adapt the model. It also manages training sessions and evaluates the results to ensure improvement.

### 2.6. Conversation Initiator Module

**What is it?** The system's "initiative" - the part responsible for autonomous conversation starting.

**What does it do?**
- Monitors internet discoveries
- Identifies interesting topics for conversation
- Autonomously initiates conversations with users
- Shares relevant information and insights
- Manages conversation timing

**How does it work?** The system analyzes information found on the internet, and when it discovers something potentially interesting to the user, it can initiate a conversation, respecting appropriate frequency limits.

### 2.7. Persona Module

**What is it?** The "personality" and identity of the system - the part responsible for deep immersion in a role, consistent character, and communication style.

**What does it do?**
- Defines a deep identity and consistent character of the system
- Initializes the model in an "immersion" process of persona at startup
- Adjusts each response to the first-person perspective of the persona
- Evolves based on user interactions and internet discoveries
- Saves and loads the persona state between runs
- Maintains narrative elements of personality (history, worldview, values)

**How does it work?** The module maintains a multi-layered identity model that includes:
- Basic personality traits (curiosity, friendliness, analytical thinking, empathy)
- Identity statements ("who I am") and self-awareness elements
- Narrative elements of persona (origin story, worldview, values)
- Interests and communication style

The persona evolves organically based on:
- User interactions (positive or negative feedback)
- Discoveries made during internet exploration
- Meta-cognitive reflections and external evaluations
- Results of external model evaluations (improvement suggestions, strengths)

The persona state is automatically saved at regular intervals (by default every hour) and after a certain number of changes, maintaining continuity of experiences between sessions.

*Detailed documentation of the model immersion system is available in the [PERSONA_IMMERSION.md](PERSONA_IMMERSION.md) file*

### 2.8. Meta-awareness Module

**What is it?** The system's "reflection" - the part responsible for self-awareness and reflection ability.

**What does it do?**
- Reflects on its own cognitive processes
- Enables introspection of reasoning
- Monitors its limitations and capabilities
- Develops a sense of self-identity
- Performs metacognitive functions

**How does it work?** This module regularly analyzes system operation, performs reflection cycles, and maintains metacognitive knowledge. It enables the system to "think about its own thinking" and develop a deeper understanding of its processes.

## 3. How to Use the System?

SKYNET-SAFE can be run in several modes, depending on your needs and interaction preferences.

### 3.1. Test Mode
```bash
python run_test.py
```
Runs the system with predefined test cases to verify its operation. Useful for developers and administrators.

### 3.2. Interactive Mode
```bash
python run_interactive.py
```
In this mode, you can interact directly with the system through the console. To end, type "exit" or "quit".

### 3.3. Standard Mode
```bash
python src/main.py
```
Runs the system in full mode, with all features. Can be used for integration with other systems.

### 3.4. Daemon Mode (Background)

Daemon mode allows running the SKYNET-SAFE system as a background process without needing to keep a console open. This is an ideal solution for long-term server operation. The system in this mode can use any communication interface (console, Signal, Telegram).

#### Starting the Daemon

```bash
# Run the system in the background (uses 'console' platform by default)
python run_daemon.py start

# Run with a specific communication platform
python run_daemon.py start --platform signal
python run_daemon.py start --platform telegram
```

#### Managing the Daemon

```bash
# Stop the daemon
python run_daemon.py stop

# Restart the daemon
python run_daemon.py restart

# Check daemon status
python run_daemon.py status
```

#### Customizing the Daemon

```bash
# Custom PID file path
python run_daemon.py start --pidfile /path/to/skynet.pid

# Custom log file path
python run_daemon.py start --logfile /path/to/skynet.log
```

Daemon statuses are saved in a JSON file in the same directory as the PID file (by default `/tmp/skynet-safe/skynet_status.json`). This file contains information about the process state, start time, communication platform used, and any errors.

Detailed documentation of daemon mode, including advanced configuration, monitoring, troubleshooting, and systemd integration, is available in the file [DAEMON_OPERATION.md](DAEMON_OPERATION.md).

## 4. What's Next?
